* This introductory project simulates essential real-world DevOps practices through a streamlined web server deployment.
  It mirrors production environment setup by configuring NGINX on standard port 80, ensuring public accessibility and continuous uptime - exactly how actual websites operate.
  The simulation covers core infrastructure management including cloud provisioning, system maintenance, firewall configuration, and service monitoring.
  It also introduces deployment pipeline fundamentals by handling code deployment to the server, configuration management, and quality verification through
  accessibility testing.
